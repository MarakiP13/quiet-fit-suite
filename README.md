# Quiet Fit

A small set of self-checks for people whose intelligence works well,
but not everywhere.

This is not a personality system.
It does not rank, diagnose, or optimize people.

Quiet Fit exists to help people notice when difficulty is caused by
**context mismatch rather than personal deficiency**.

---

## What’s included

- **Thinking Fit Check**  
  How thinking responds to pressure, commitment, and coherence.

- **Learning Fit Check**  
  Which learning formats support understanding rather than exhaust it.

- **Status Fit Check**  
  Sensitivity to unspoken rank, default positioning, and quiet inequality.

- **Context vs Condition Check**  
  Whether difficulties change with environment or persist across contexts.

## What this is not

- Not a diagnostic system
- Not therapy
- Not productivity advice
- Not a hiring or screening tool

These checks are descriptive, not prescriptive.

---

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any browser, or host the folder on any static host
(GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).

You do not need to complete all checks.
Enter where recognition happens.

## Design principles

- Quiet by default
- No urgency
- No scoring-as-identity
- No forced interpretation
- Exit is always allowed

If this becomes performative, it has failed.
